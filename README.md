femex v.1.0.0
=============

Research use for coding with PDE/FEM in 2D. Tested on Matlab 2013a.

System Requirements:
* g++/gcc-4.7+
* gfortran-4.7+ and gfortran-4.4(maybe)
* Matlab 2013a+

if you would like to use AGMG-3.0 as solver, ``gfortran-4.4`` is also needed. 
Thanks to ``ABI``, gfortran 4.7+ can link libraries on compiled files from gfortran 4.4.

ILUPACK is already included for a choice of solvers.

How to use:
-----------
Simply add femex directory to current workspace path.

Follow the example to set up boundary conditions.
